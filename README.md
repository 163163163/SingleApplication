SingleApplication
=================

This is a replacement of QSingleApplication for Qt5.

P.S. I will document it dome day, when I have time.
Otherwise it is pretty straighforward. I added a signal to notify the root proccess that another instance had been started. You can use it to raise the Main window of the root app, for example.
